# FormBotWPF

There is a form where promotion codes can be uploaded. My problem is that this form is not sticky, so you have to add all the data for each and every promotion codes.
I wanted to create a solution for this.
I didn't want to create a bot, of course, but a solution which fills the form, so only the new promotion code has to be added, not everything.

I have a bit of professional experience with Selenium, that's why I decided to use it.

I wanted to practice at the same time, that's why I've created a robust WPF app for it.

It is not yet ready, smaller bug fixes, improvements and refactorings are still needed.
Sorry for the Hungarian form, localization is also still in progress.
